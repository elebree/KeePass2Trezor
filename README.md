# üîê KeePass2Trezor

This plugin for [KeePass 2.x](https://keepass.info/) uses [Trezor's](https://trezor.io/) security design to encrypt the password database.
The decryption key can only be read from the Trezor by physically pressing the confirmation button on the Trezor device. 

## Review

* KeePass database securely encrypted with your personal TREZOR device.
* A simple click on your Trezor button to unlock your password manager.
* Use a 24 words recovery seed to regain access to your passwords.
* Can be used with or without master password.

## How to use

* Copy __TrezorKeyProviderPlugin.dll__ from the [latest release](https://github.com/vnau/keepass2trezor/releases) to the **Plugin** folder of the [KeePass 2.x](https://keepass.info/).
* Create a new database selecting __Trezor Key Provider__ in the __Key file/provider__ field.
* Follow instructions, unlock Trezor if necessary and confirm decryption of the key by clicking button on the device.

## Dependencies

* _Keepass 2.35_ or newer
* _.NET Framework 4.6.1_ or higher

## Technical details

__Keepass2Trezor__ is a _key provider plugin_ for the KeePass 2.x password manager. It uses much the same approach to derive master key as [Trezor Password Manager](https://trezor.io/passwords/) described in the [SLIP-0016](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0016.md) document.
